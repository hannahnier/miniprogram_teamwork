# **Teamwork - A mini app for terminal**

**What this is about**

This terminal-based mini program simulates a system for managing a number of different tasks or To-Dos (e.g. for working together in a team).

For demonstrational purpose, a small number of tasks is provided upfront. Users can edit or delete existing tasks, create new tasks or sort the tasks by different categories such as priority or date. Tasks are automatically assigned the date of their creation or last update.

**Try it out!**

After making sure that you have all the required packages ("npm install"), simply start the program in terminal via node ("node app") and follow the instructions.
